Mr. HOT offers customized meals so that you can choose what you want to eat as per your whims and wishes.Unlike any other tiffin service provider, Mr. HOT gives you the choice of deciding your own personalized menu. Their meals are based on a sound bed rock of nutrition research, designed by a team of expert chefs.

They offer different varieties of dishes which includes Indian, Chinese, Italian,Exotic Deserts, Shakes and Drinks and other fast food products.

My work was basically to develop an android app from scratch for ordering food online.
Features Implemented:-
- Share & Earn
- Manage account
- Push Notifications for updates and offers
- Login/Sign up/Reset Password
- App for admin
Adding a payment gateway, and finally, move it to production. It also works offline. 

It was a great pleasure for me to work with Mr. Hot team.
