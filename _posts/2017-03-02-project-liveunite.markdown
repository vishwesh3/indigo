LiveUnite app allows you to discover nearby people based on your geographical location to better choose who you hang out with, travel, date, become your neighbors, roommates, and learn, teach, and express yourself.

My work was basically to develop an android app from scratch for such an amazing platform. App, where user can easily create their account with a single click, and within seconds upload their first post. Get the feeds from nearby people and locate them on the map. Place where user can customize their feeds according to distance and age.    

It was a great pleasure for me to work with LiveUnite team.
