Nice that you’re here. This is my personal blog which includes my work experience, tricks, tutorials etc. Not regularly, but as soon as I got some stuff in my mind.
If you have any questions, just let me know. I will be happy to address them.

I love to address questions and find its best optimal solution. From last 7-8 months, I am also answering on [stackoverflow](http://bit.ly/vjkstack). Suddenly I thought that why shouldn't I write a blog to share my work, interest etc. That's why I have created this corner to share my blogs. Thanks [@sergiokopplin](http://koppl.in/) for providing such a beautiful theme.

Also, sometimes I might write about Opensource technology (yeah! I’m in love with the open source from past some time), besides that whatever new technology I work with there will definitely be some stuff about that as well. After entering into the world of developing I have learned a lot from blogs, online tutorials, existing code on GitHub etc, this is also a reason why I have created this corner. To make available my experiences so that upcoming generation can take advantage of this and learn better from experience than experimenting already experimented stuff.

Thanks for being here and stay tuned for my upcoming blogs.
