Wimator is an easy solution for auto login/logout in Captive Portals. It will automatically login in enabled WiFi networks whenever device gets connected. It allows users to manage WiFi networks for which auto login/logout should be performed. It also creates WiFi sessions which include IP address of the device; might be useful to log out portal from another device.

## Developer's note

My university allows only one login per internet portal. While returning from LT area or canteen I usually forget to log off my portal and thus I can't access internet in my hostel ("Maximum login limit") until my portal is automatically logged off. I developed this app so that portal gets automatically logged off whenever WiFi strength becomes low. App shows an notification, which reminds me to log off before I turn off WiFi.
